## Getting Started ‚ú®

### Installation and Configuration

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OmniaBuild/Omnia.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Omnia

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create a .env file in the project root with the necessary credentials
echo "ACTION_API_KEY=<your-api-key>" >> .env
echo "SOLANA_RPC_URL=<your-solana-rpc-endpoint>" >> .env

# Ensure your Solana wallet is configured and accessible
solana config set --keypair <path-to-your-wallet-keypair>

# Run predefined tasks using the CLI
pnpm start <task_name> --options

# Example task execution
pnpm start send_transaction --recipient=<address> --amount=<value>

```


## Roadmap üö©

We aim to build the **most advanced interface** for the Solana Network, enabling users to design AI agents for **autonomous actions and custom strategies**. These agents merge live blockchain data with real-time internet insights, offering an integrated solution for managing the crypto ecosystem.

Our current focus is developing **core infrastructure and agent functionality**.
